# Opportunity X — Engineering Decision Log

Append-only journal of significant engineering decisions. Newest first.
One entry per milestone task: feature, purpose, files, dependencies, risks,
testing, future work. See `CLAUDE.md` for when an entry is required.

## 2026-07-29 — Adopt program governance system (PMGS + ARB, QAG, FVG)

**Purpose.** Prevent architectural drift by replacing continuous ad-hoc coding
with phase gates, quality gates, and explicit stop conditions.

**Files.** `CLAUDE.md` (operating contract, auto-loaded each session),
`docs/ROADMAP.md` (phases + verified status), `docs/DECISION_LOG.md` (this file).

**Decisions.**
- Governance written to `CLAUDE.md` rather than kept as a chat prompt, so it
  survives session boundaries. A pasted prompt governs one session; this governs
  the repository.
- ARB, QAG, and FVG folded into `CLAUDE.md` as sections rather than separate
  documents — three more files that must each be remembered is a weaker control
  than one file that loads automatically.
- Progress-tracker output scoped to milestone work only. Printing a status
  dashboard after trivial exchanges produces noise that trains readers to skip
  it, defeating its purpose.

**Findings from the first governed assessment.** Two roadmap features believed
present were false positives: `Interview` is an application status enum, not
interview preparation; `Calendar` is a lucide icon, not calendar integration.
Both would have been reported complete without verification. Quality gates fail
repo-wide (4 TS errors, ~28,540 lint errors, zero tests), so no phase can
currently be closed honestly.

**Risks.** Governance overhead on small tasks; mitigated by the explicit
calibration note in `CLAUDE.md`. Roadmap accuracy decays unless updated —
`docs/ROADMAP.md` must be revised whenever a phase materially changes.

**Future work.** Quality gate remediation, then close Phase 2 (auth).

## 2026-07-28 — Migrate off Lovable platform

**Purpose.** The app depended on Lovable's proprietary platform for its build
config, OAuth, AI gateway, and database. Continuing required a Lovable
subscription; the goal was full independence.

**Files.** `vite.config.ts` (rewritten without `@lovable.dev/vite-tanstack-config`),
`src/lib/ai.server.ts` (new), `src/lib/intelligence.functions.ts`,
`src/lib/execution.functions.ts`, `src/routes/auth.tsx`, `src/routes/__root.tsx`,
`.env`, `supabase/config.toml`, `bun.lock`, `bunfig.toml`, `package.json`.
Deleted: `src/integrations/lovable/`, `src/lib/lovable-error-reporting.ts`,
`.lovable/`, `package-lock.json`.

**Decisions.**
- **AI:** replaced the metered Lovable AI Gateway (`ai.gateway.lovable.dev`,
  Gemini 2.5 Flash) with direct Anthropic Claude calls via a shared
  `callClaude()` helper. `claude-haiku-4-5` chosen to match the previous model's
  role as the cheap/fast workhorse across frequent calls.
- **Auth:** replaced `@lovable.dev/cloud-auth-js` OAuth proxy with native
  `supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth`. Simplified the handler — the native flow is
  always a full-page redirect, so the popup branch was removed.
- **Build:** read the Lovable Vite wrapper's source and reconstructed only its
  functional pieces (Tailwind, tsconfig paths, TanStack Start, Nitro/Cloudflare,
  React). Dropped sandbox-only behavior: asset proxy, HMR gate, dev-server
  bridge, forced port 8080. Dev server consequently moved 8080 → 5173.
- **Database:** repointed from the Lovable-managed Supabase project to a
  user-owned one. Schema recreated from `supabase/migrations/` via the SQL editor.
- **Lockfile:** regenerated `bun.lock` — it pinned tarball URLs to Lovable's
  private registry mirror, which 403s anywhere else, so `bun install` was
  impossible outside their sandbox.

**Risks.**
- Migration `20260614054040_*.sql` duplicates tables created by the migration
  before it; running the set in order fails on "relation already exists". The
  duplicate section must be skipped on a fresh database. **Not yet fixed in the
  file** — a fresh environment will hit this.
- Google OAuth code is migrated but the provider is unconfigured in the new
  Supabase project, so sign-in via Google is currently broken.
- Discovery cron was pointing at a dead Lovable preview URL with a stale anon
  key; the schedule was removed and must be recreated post-deployment.
- The AI pipeline has never run against the live web on Claude.

**Testing.** `bun install`, `bun run build` (Cloudflare output unchanged), and
`bun run dev` verified. Landing, auth, and search pages screenshot-verified.
Auth gate confirmed: `/dashboard` redirects to `/auth` when unauthenticated.
Not tested: anything requiring live Supabase or Anthropic network access — the
dev sandbox blocked both.
